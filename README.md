## About the Repository

### General
Here you will find community and my own script solutions for various RP concepts, server management, and more.

The main programming language here is **Lua**, with various script solutions that include other languages or tools like **JavaScript, TypeScript, React, jQuery, HTML/CSS**.

This is an older project that I worked on when I was younger and less experienced. You may find **outdated, non-functional, unusual, or otherwise unconventional methodologies** and **unprofessional repository management** here.

#### To distinguish between community and my own solutions:
- Files and directories with names that contain **"strin"** or **"rave"** are my own solutions (or heavily modified community solutions).
- Other files and directories are community solutions that may contain my modifications, or they are unmarked/general solutions that may or may not have been created by me.

## About the Project

### General
This project aimed to create a **technically skilled and community-driven Czechoslovakian FiveM Roleplay server**.

The main idea behind the server was:  
> *"From players, for players."*

Based on this idea, we planned to build a **friendly, fun, yet professional environment**.

We wanted to take **old, overused (but somewhat beloved by the community) features** and give them **our own interesting, original, and creative twist**.

However, we did **not** aim to create a completely different experience than what we’ve known since the early days of the CZ/SK roleplay scene.  
**On the contrary, we wanted to preserve it while giving it a fresh touch.**

### What happened to the project?
Over time, the project simply **faded into "oblivion".**

From my perspective as the project founder (**Strin**), there were several reasons for this:
- Overambition
- Immaturity
- Lack of professionalism
- Disinterest / lack of motivation
- Burnout
- And more...

But you know what? As a group of friends, **we had plenty of fun with this project during the summer holidays**, we met each other outside of the screen, and in the end, it **wasn’t about the project itself but about the people who came together while creating it**.

With that said, I want to **thank everyone who actively contributed to the project**.

---

### Why did I make the technical solution public?
My FiveM chapter is **long behind me**.  
At the same time, I put a **huge amount of time and energy** into this project, so I don’t want it all to go to waste.

I’m leaving it open for anyone to:
- Take whatever they need from the solutions
- Or just look back at the work that was done

## **By releasing this repository, I am officially announcing the definitive end and closure of *The Rave Project*.**

## **If you plan to use anything I created, please consider giving credit or a shoutout.**

### Thank you all and best of luck.
